Bootstrap Docs: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/]

## Instructions

- Recreate the mockup provided in the `design` directory as best as you can. Use the `index.html` file.
- No custom CSS stylesheet or inline style, use only **Bootstrap classes**.
- Once you are done, commit and push.

## Notes

### Header

- On large screens, the search form is between the logo and the menu. On smaller screens, the order is switched and the search form is after the menu.
- The last menu item is disabled. You should not be able to click on it.

### Sidebar

- On large screens, the blue sidebar is on the left of the main content. On smaller screens, the sidebar goes below the main content.

### Main Content

#### Table

The table needs to be responsive when the table no longer fits the screen.

#### Login Form

The two labels are floating labels. When you click on the input field, the label will float to the top part of the input.
